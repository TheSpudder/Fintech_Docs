## Evolution!

<span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">**The Barter System**</span> [**3000 BC**]</span>

The earliest form of trading was known as <span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">bartering.</span> The barter system involved a physical direct exchange of goods and services without a medium of exchange. Bartering actually worked pretty great but had a few key problems. Firstly, both parties needed to have something that the other did not which can be a serious issue. Secondly, there was no standard measure to determine how much of one good was worth in comparison to another. How many apples is a cow worth? Moreover, dividing that cow wasn't very practical if the individial did not want to sell the whole cow. A universal system was needed leading to the invention of the commodity.

<span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">**Commodities**</span> [**3000 BC - 600BC**]</span>

The next form of trading were known as <span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">commodities.</span> These commodities provided a currency of some sort. For example, in Ancient China they used seashell, and Ancient Mesopotamians used grain, also salt and gold were common commodities. Salt was especially highly valued in these ancient civilizations. Commodities gave a medium of exchange. Now by just holding salt, I could guarantee myself access to a number of goods. Commodities lead to an extreme boom of trade, which only got more exponential as time passed. While this was great, metal coins are even better.

  B[Alice's Shop
  1kg of salt = steak
////
  10kg of salt = horse
////
  20kg of salt = 100g gold];
  B[Alice's Shop
  1kg of salt = steak
////
  10kg of salt = horse
////
  20kg of salt = 100g gold] -->|steak| A[Bob]
```

<span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">**Metal Coinage**</span> [**600 BC - 700 CE**]</span>

An invidiual with <span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">coins</span> can now carry enough money to buy most everyday goods in the palm of their hands. The issue with commodities is that its quite difficult to carry 1000 kilograms of any commiditiy for large transactions. A coin can be valued at as litle or as much as the authority decides. Coins made trade accessible, more lightweight and centralized. A standard for currency, backed usually by governments, and widely accepted.

  1 Coin = steak
////
  2 Coins = horse
////
  10 Coins = 100g gold] -->|1 steak, 2 horses, 100g gold| A[Bob]
```

<span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">**Paper Money**</span> [**700 CE - 1920s**]

As trade grew and kingdoms expanded, carrying large amounts of metal coins became impractical and heavy. Enter <span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">paper money</span>—first used in China around the 7th century. The idea was simple: paper bills represented a claim on metal or other commodities, which made it easier to carry large sums and trade over long distances. This innovation unlocked even more potential for economic expansion, and allowed for easy lightweight trade.

<span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">**The Rise of Banking Systems**</span> [**1500 CE - Present**]

As societies advanced and the scale of trade grew, <span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">banks</span> began to emerge. Early banks in Europe served as safe deposit boxes, and they offered a way to transfer money across long distances. The introduction of checks and promissory notes allowed merchants to conduct business without carrying large sums of cash. Banks eventually took on a central role in facilitating the money supply, offering loans to individuals and businesses, and managing national currencies.

One significant shift was the development of central banks, which could issue currency on behalf of governments. The Bank of England, founded in 1694, is one of the earliest examples of a central bank. These institutions began managing the monetary systems of nations and played a crucial role in global finance. Banks paved the way for modern economies to flourish, expanding the influence of money on both national and international scales.

<span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">**The Gold Standard**</span> [**1800s - Early 20th Century**]

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many nations adopted the <span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">gold standard</span>—a system in which paper money was directly tied to a specific amount of gold. This was intended to provide stability and prevent inflation. Under the gold standard, nations needed to hold gold reserves that could be exchanged for paper currency.

However, the gold standard had limitations, especially during times of war or economic crises, and was observed when governments needed to print more money than they could back with gold. The system was eventually abandoned in the 20th century, notably during the Great Depression, and countries transitioned to fiat currencies, which are not backed by physical commodities.

```
<span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">**Fiat Money**</span> [**1930s - Present**]

With the abandonment of the gold standard, <span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">fiat money</span> became the new standard. Fiat money is currency that has no intrinsic value but derives its value from the trust and backing of the government that issues it. This transition allowed governments more flexibility in managing their economies by controlling the money supply through monetary policies.

Fiat money is now the standard form of currency globally, and the power of central banks to issue money has become a cornerstone of modern economics. Central banks use tools like interest rates and inflation targeting to maintain economic stability and encourage growth.

<span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">**The Rise of Credit**</span> [**1900s - Present**]

As economies became more complex, credit began to play a significant role in finance. The advancement of <span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">credit cards</span> in the mid-20th century revolutionized consumer spending. Credit cards allowed individuals to purchase goods and services without immediate payment, creating a new form of borrowing and lending.

The rise of consumer credit and the expansion of credit institutions facilitated greater spending, but also led to new financial risks. In the modern economy, credit remains a major driver of economic activity, but it has also contributed to financial crises when borrowing exceeds the capacity to repay.
