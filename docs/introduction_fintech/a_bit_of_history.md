# **A Bit Of History**

## Evolution!

<span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">**The Barter System**</span> [**3000 BC**]</span>

The earliest form of trading was known as <span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">bartering.</span> The barter system involved a physical direct exchange of goods and services without a medium of exchange. Bartering actually worked pretty great but had a few key problems. Firstly, both parties needed to have something that the other did not which can be a serious issue. Secondly, there was no standard measure to determine how much of one good was worth in comparison to another. How many apples is a cow worth? Moreover, dividing that cow wasn't very practical if the individial did not want to sell the whole cow. A universal system was needed leading to the invention of the commodity.

The next form of trading were known as <span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">commodities.</span> These commodities provided a currency of some sort. For example, in Ancient China they used seashell, and Ancient Mesopotamians used grain, also salt and gold were common commodities. Salt was especially highly valued in these ancient civilizations. Commodities gave a medium of exchange. Now by just holding salt, I could guarantee myself access to a number of goods. Commodities lead to an extreme boom of trade, which only got more exponential as time passed. While this was great, metal coins are even better.

  A[Bob] -->|1kg of salt| B[Alice's Shop];
  
  B[Alice's Shop
  1kg of salt = steak
////
  10kg of salt = horse
////
  20kg of salt = 100g gold];
  B[Alice's Shop
  1kg of salt = steak
////
  10kg of salt = horse
////
  20kg of salt = 100g gold] -->|steak| A[Bob]
```

<span style="color: mediumspringgreen;">**Metal Coinage**</span> [**600 BC - 700 CE**]</span>

Ok, im about to glaze coins because, COINS literally made trade what it is today. The individual can now carry enough money to buy anything IN THE PALM OF THEIR HAND. The issue with commodities is that, its quite difficult to carry 1000 kilograms of salt or any commiditiy in great quantity for large transactions. A coin can be valued at as litle or as much as the authority decides. Coins made trade accessible, lightweight and centralized. A standard for currency, backed usually by governments, and widely accepted, seems great right? The human mind is powerful and we did better with paper money!
!!! note

    Bob decides to buy **1 steak for 1 coin**, **2 horses for 4 coins**, and **100g of gold for 5 coins** using all **10** of his coins.

  A[Bob] -->|10 Coins| B[Alice's Shop];
  
  B[Alice's Shop
  1 Coin = steak
////
  2 Coins = horse
////
  5 Coins = 100g gold];
  B[Alice's Shop
  1 Coin = steak
////
  2 Coins = horse
////
  10 Coins = 100g gold] -->|1 steak, 2 horses, 100g gold| A[Bob]
```
