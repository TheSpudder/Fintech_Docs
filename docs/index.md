## Story
--------
*"When entering University at Buffalo, there is a limited amount of opportunity regarding Financial Technology; this club and its documentation aim to bridge the gap created by this disparity"* - Nicholas Toutoundjian



 <span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 2;">*I was first introduced to Financial Technology through Bitcoin mining in 2019. I stumbled upon Bitcoin mining via Nicehash, a service that at the time mined Ethereum and converted it into Bitcoin. While I was initially just looking for ways to make an extra dollar, I quickly saw the potential of cryptocurrency, particularly blockchain technology. Depositing a check, sending mail—both require time and come with fees. The ability to be the sole owner of one’s finances, with full authority and minimal fees, is revolutionary.*</span>

Blockchain technology is only a small part of the broader fintech landscape. We are still in the early stages!
