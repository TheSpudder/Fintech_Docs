**The Official Documentation for Financial Technolgy Club at UB**, reach out if you want to contribute to the docs!

All open source, so if you ever want to make your own docs or something its actually pretty straightforward

This documentation was made to teach core introductory concepts like the history of money, and modern banking systems to a group of 20+ students during one of our club meetings. I plan to update the documentation for future club meetings!


**How I made the docs:**

Leveraged the MkDocs Material framework as the foundation, but extended it significantly by customizing the theme and navigation for optimal usability and aesthetics. Structured content modularly to support iterative expansion and maintainability. The project also follows open-source best practices, enabling easy community contributions and collaborative development.

**Why it matters:**

Providing clear, accessible educational content is critical to students as I saw a lack of opportunity at UB regarding financial technology and blockchain. This resource enhances learning engagement, supports club initiatives, and establishes a scalable knowledge base for ongoing education and future events.
